## Resources used in task implementation

To understand the Opacus library use with the BERT model. The code implementation is used in the DP BERT model and Keyword mask BERT model

Tutorial followed for the implementation of BERT model for sentiment analysis task

## Run instruction
The notebooks are Jupyter notebook, so it could be run on the (Google Colab)[https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index] by cloning the github repository. The dependencies are installed in the Jupyter notebook itself. So, you would require to run those cell in jupyter notebook to install dependencies.
